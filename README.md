# HST_QSO_Photometry

This repository contains a code for Apparture Photometry of data taken by the Wide Field Camera 3 located on Hubble Space Telescope. 

## Requirements

* `anaconda` with `python 3.7`
* `astropy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` packages
* A basic understanding of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files and their structure

## Repository Scripts Overview

This repository contains a few scripts:
* Step 1 is Angular alignment. As a preperatory stage before stacking the images.
* Step 2 is Stacking two images stored in two FITS files. 
* Step 3 is Aperture Photometry. 

## Observational data

This code was used to analyze data obtained with HST WFC3 NIR F140W (Hubble Space Telescope, Wide Field Camera 3, Near InfraRed Channel, ~14000 Angstrom wavelength). 

The principal investigator of the proposel is Trakhtenbrot Benny (Tel Aviv University, Israel).
